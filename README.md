# Insurance Purchase Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project, developed during my data science internship at Eisystems Technologies, aims to predict insurance purchase likelihood using a logistic regression model. The project includes a fully functional Streamlit app that allows users to interact with the model and visualize predictions.

## Project Overview
During my internship at Eisystems Technologies, I received training and practical experience in data science. My primary project involved building a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer would purchase insurance based on a given dataset.

### Features
- **Interactive Streamlit App**: An easy-to-use interface for making predictions and visualizing results.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Logistic regression model built using `scikit-learn`.
- **Data Visualization**: Various plots and charts to understand data distributions and model performance using `matplotlib`.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project, you need to have Python and Streamlit installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-purchase-prediction.git
   cd insurance-purchase-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Libraries Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web app.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the logistic regression model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository as `data.csv`. It contains various features relevant to insurance purchase prediction.

## Usage
1. Launch the Streamlit app using the command mentioned above.
2. Upload your dataset or use the provided `data.csv`.
3. Explore the data through visualizations.
4. Make predictions using the logistic regression model.
5. Visualize the prediction results and model performance.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main script to run the Streamlit app.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset used for model training and predictions.
- `model.py`: Script containing the logistic regression model implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required libraries.
